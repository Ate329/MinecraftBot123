# To-Do
This repository was created a long time ago but for some reasons it started being forked by people.  
Therefore, I guess I am going to start updating this repository if I have time.  

 - [ ] Allows the bot to follow a specific players and avoid obstacles.  

# Server List 
Go to ServerList.txt and add servers (cracked).

# Libraries
threading   
    
webbrowser    
    
configparser    
    
tkinter   
    
javascript    

## Special instructions for using devenv
You should run `npm install` first to install all necessary dependencies.
JsPyBridge should have provided a workaround, but perhaps due to NixOS peculiarities it may not work.
